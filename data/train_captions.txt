books0977:  A Good Book (1905), Paul Gustave Fischer (Danish, 1860-1934). Warm and inviting, has multi-colored furniture all jumbled close together, a trickle of ivy, and the rumpled throw on the chair. The reading woman herself appears comfortable and peaceful. Red flows through her cranberry colored skirt, her soft blouse with the faintest of red polka dots, and the red ribbon in her hair. Her cheeks have the faintest of blushes and her mouth opens slightly, as if she might be reading something romantic or even a tiny bit risque.

She wears a pale grey-blue dress of the 18th century with elaborate sleeves, a deep neck-line, and large skirt. She is standing behind a large wooden table strewn with papers and framed by two large candelabras. Catherine is leant forwards with her palms planted on the table, assertive.

"Luis from Quincy WA. - By: Angel Colmenares  chemicalangel.com   I've worked as a photographer in New York and a Cinematographer in Los Angeles for ten years, shot films, commercials, and music videos, but now with Wet Plate,  I learned about Wet Plate in early 2016, I purchased an old Ansco 8x10 camera, found a Dallmeyer lens on eBay, searched for a workshop, and turned an old work trailer into a darkroom.  I met Luis when I was looking to photograph another group of people that are close to my heart, ""Immigrants"". Since I'm a immigrant from Cuba that left because of political reasons, I knew that I wanted to capture the people that cross the border searching for a better life, the people that work the fields, the illegal aliens that take work that no other American would.  I want to photograph people that matter, even when they believe they don't matter, people that struggle for a cause, no matter what cause, people that stand up to adversity, the people that makes America work everyday, and are not recognized by their efforts or creativity, just real people."

Guardians of the Galaxy  Mission: BREAKOUT! -- Debuting in summer 2017, Guardians of the Galaxy  Mission: BREAKOUT! will take Disney California Adventure park guests through the fortress-like museum of the mysterious Collector, who is keeping his newest acquisitions, the Guardians of the Galaxy, as prisoners. Guests will board a gantry lift which launches them into a daring adventure as they join Rocket Raccoon in an attempt to set free his fellow Guardians. The new attraction will transform the structure currently housing The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror into an epic new adventure, enhancing the breathtaking free fall sensation with new visual and audio effects to create a variety of ride experiences. Guests will experience multiple, random and unique ride profiles in which the rise and fall of the gantry lift rocks to the beat of music inspired by the film's popular soundtrack.

On June 30,1864, President Lincoln signed the Yosemite Land Grant, protecting the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley – an area that would later become Yosemite National Park. It was the first time the government protected land because of its natural beauty so that people could enjoy it. Thanks to John Muir's passionate writing to further protect the delicate ecosystem of the High Sierra, Yosemite became our nation's 3rd national park 26 years later.

We went for an evening paddle after dinner on our last night in Killarney Provincial Park, Ontario and we were treated to this spectacular sunset. It made the chilly, rainy nights worthwhile and has inspired us to do more autumn camping this year. Killarney is my favourite place to go camping in Ontario, if you would like to learn more about the area, you may be interested in this   travel guide   that I wrote about our experiences there.

A turreted, sprawling stone castle, bronzed by the setting sun, crowns a rocky cliff at the center of this horizontal landscape painting. A round turret rises in the center of the castle's jumble of blocky, square buildings, dramatically outlined against a mass of roiling charcoal-grey and indigo-blue clouds edged in coral-peach in the upper right corner. Barely noticeable amid the hulking structure, a scarlet-red flag flutters from a window in the tower overlooking a distant crag to our right, where a column of amber smoke rises to mingle with the clouds above a bright band of sunlight on the horizon. A jumble of low trees and bushes cluster at the base of the battlements, with their crenellated roofs and lighted windows, and lead down the steep slope towards us to a river below the cliff. Through the tangle of trees, a dirt road winds down the hill to a bridge of pale stone that crosses the river in front of us, to our left of center. Groups of helmeted horsemen cross the bridge, passing under a stone archway at its center. Near the bridge, tiny in scale, a herd of goats capers on the road around the horsemen as they ride on in a double column coming towards us along the clay-colored road. One rider carries a red pennant fluttering in the breeze. The riders wear ruby-red tunics and carry upright lances and shields. Light glints off their armor and helmets as they head to our right, toward the dark mass of tangled trees and rocky cliff on the border of the picture. A copse of low, gnarled trees grows near the opposite edge of the painting, to our left. Behind these trees and riders stretches a river valley spanned by another massive, stone bridge. A cluster of people can barely be seen near and along the bridge in the distance. Beyond, buildings and a tall, square tower are lit by fires belching clouds of smoke. A heavy bank of grey fog clouds obscures the rest of the valley. Birds soar in the mist near a distant cliff, where flames and more smoke rises behind a ro

"""Photo: The Unknown Land - Li River, China   After a while, my boat driver thought I was insane.  We started before the sunrise and kept going, and going, and going, and going... he kept giving me the international head movement for """"we really should be returning for a spot of tea,"""" but I kept motioning him further up the river.  To me, the river got most interesting when we saw no more people, except for the occasional fisherman that still had remote hut for his family along the river.  I had plenty of battery power, amazing music on my iPod, a full array of snacks, a ton of drinks, and nothing to do for the rest of the day and night... so I was perfectly content just going until our gas tank reached 50%.  And that took a long time... and who would want to stop with views like this around every other turn?  from the blog www.stuckincustoms.com"""

BEA air stewardesses in their uniform designed by Hardy Amies in 1972. He created them to allow the expression of individuality achieved by interchangeable colours of the blouses and scarves based on the strong red, white and blue theme associated with BEA. The short Tutankhamun hat is in French blue, trimmed with BEA red Petersham ribbon and was designed to be worn on the back of the head. It was adopted as the first uniform of the newly-created British Airways.

Meals on wheels: Trains played an important role in ferrying the rescued soldiers out of Kent, away from the busy ports and to their barracks. Multiple operators pooled 2,000 carriages to hastily form the transports, which were nicknamed Dynamo Specials. To avoid delay, it was decided that the soldiers, many of whom had not eaten properly for days, would be fed on the trains from designated feeding stations along the route, manned by a mixture of volunteers and military personnel

On June 30,1864, President Lincoln signed the Yosemite Land Grant, protecting the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley – an area that would later become Yosemite National Park. It was the first time the government protected land because of its natural beauty so that people could enjoy it. Thanks to John Muir's passionate writing to further protect the delicate ecosystem of the High Sierra, Yosemite became our nation's 3rd national park 26 years later.

Depending on the colorful arrangement some streetseller are more promising than others. Some are brining in their mobile kitchen to prepare food on the spot. Others offer loads of clothing or even haircuts. There is the coffee guy, flower an veggie ladies, the shoe-shine boy, a karaoke singer duo.

Actress Veronica Lake. All the girls wanted to wear their hair like this, but unfortunately their tresses would get caught in the machinery as they worked in the factories during the war. Ouch!!! The government actually made an instructional video with Ms. Lake to encourage ladies to either put their hair up or just cut it. When envisioning characters for my supernatural spy thriller set in the 1940's, I totally see the vampire Casandra looking like this.  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005QSFXC6

The Bay at Portofino This isn't really Portofino, but it sure does look like it, eh? We might even make the case that it is more pretty than the real Portofino! This is a beautiful resort in Orlando, over at Universal Studios.  All the colors in the sky and the buildings seemed to melt together, so I stopped for a quick photo.- Trey RatcliffClick here to read the rest of this post at the Stuck in Customs blog.

Saguaro Moonset - Saguaro National Park, Tucson, Arizona<br /> *<br /> Nikon D5, 14-24mm f/2.8, f/2.8, 30sec, ISO5000<br /> *<br /> After spending a week in Southern New Mexico for work, I decided to stop in Tucson on the way back to California for a couple of days.  I planned to shoot the Milky Way.  I think I described before how difficult it is to plan any Milky Way shooting session.  The moon is a big consideration.  The orientation of the Galactic Center is another.  Turned out, this time of the year is a pretty good choice for Tuscon night shooting because the Galactic Center is to the Southwest not long after the moon set.  That's good because it's away from the Tucson lights.<br /> *<br /> Tucson is an interesting night sky city because it promotes street lights that don't indiscriminately shine light into the sky.  Still, it's a big city and even with initiatives like that, the skies aren't perfectly dark.  Saguaro National Park is neat because the western unit is no the opposite side of a small mountain range from the center of Tucson, making night photography possible.  In fact, I probably saw at least three other photographers—including a group with a model wearing a white dress out there doing night photography.  <br /> *<br /> This image is a multi-image composite of about 20 captures.  A series of captures were made for the sky.  Another set for the foreground using techniques to control the noise from shooting long exposure.  <br /> __________<br /> #Nikon #Nikonphotography #naturephotography #nightphotography #night #astrophotography #tucson #milkyway

Mammoth Hot Springs during the summer in Yellowstone National Park. The impressive hillside of travertine terraces are formed from limestone. Thermal water rises through the limestone, carrying high amounts of the calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white mineral forming the terraces. The colorful stripes located on the terraces are formed by thermophiles, or heat-loving organisms.

Watkins Glen State Park, Finger Lakes, NY.<br /> Millions of years stare back at me.  The shale ledges, exposed by what the stream cut, caught the soft light and showed itself to me. In one of the narrowest parts of the gorge, the walls tower high above me to the forest rim, which held the fog, backlit by early morning. Perhaps because it gets less light, they named the falls after the god of the underworld.  I will let the gods fight it out, and admire the result.

Star Wars-Themed Lands Coming to Disney Parks Ð Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO Bob Iger announced at D23 EXPO 2015 that Star Wars-themed lands will be coming to Disneyland park in Anaheim, Calif., and DisneyÕs Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Fla., creating DisneyÕs largest single-themed land expansions ever at 14-acres each, transporting guests to a never-before-seen planet, a remote trading port and one of the last stops before wild space where Star Wars characters and their stories come to life. These authentic lands will have two signature attractions, including the ability to take the controls of one of the most recognizable ships in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, on a customized secret mission, and an epic Star Wars adventure that puts guests in the middle of a climactic battle.

A HURRELL PHOTOGRAPH OF JOAN CRAWFORD, INSCRIBED.
Although not directly based on the classic Humphrey Bogart film, there is definitely something to this piece that makes you think of the famous film Casablanca. It must be the combination of old-timer cars with an airplane that certainly looks as though it swooped in from yesteryear. Bringing these things together for a single acryl on canvas piece, it isn't difficult to be pulled in by the mystery of a fine art example such as this. As we move deeper and deeper into what this piece really means to us, we can find ourselves moving into another era. Available as t-shirts, wall art, or interior décor products. .<br />
